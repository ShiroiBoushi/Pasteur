# Pasteur
Paste words one by one from a word sequence.

## Usage
You can use it to split a sentence in multiple words and paste them one by one. You can also use your it to paste several time your mail and password(idk why) without needing to CTRL+C and CTRL+V and switch from windows several time. I think it can be useful for some situations.

## Requirements :

```
pip install clipboard

pip install keyboard
``` 
## How to use it :
``` 
python pasteur.py

Enter a word sequence : this is a test

Do you want to add space at the end of each word ? y/n(default): y

``` 

You can choose whether you want to add a space at the end of each word or not. By default, there are no spaces.

When you will press CTRL+V, it will paste "this" and when you will press CTRL+V again it will change with "is" and then make a loop when it reaches the end.

If you choose to add space, it will paste "this "...

You can stop the script by pressing CTRL+C in the shell.
